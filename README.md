# Ldez's Bucket
This is my scoop bucket where I add miscellaneous programs that scoop doesn't officially support.

**How to install:**

    scoop bucket add "whatever you want to call it" https://github.com/ld3z/my-bucket.git
Then see what programs I offer in this bucket by checking out the list below:

 - Stardrop: https://github.com/Floogen/Stardrop
 - Houdoku: https://github.com/xgi/houdoku

Then install any programs using `scoop install <manifest name>`

If you would like me to try to add to this list please create a new issue with a "Package add" tag to it and please add the url to your package that you would like added. Thank you!
